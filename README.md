# Chicken-Scratch
Wolfram Language version of the 2-player educational game.

Chicken Scratch is a 2-player or 2-team educational game that is designed to be run by a teacher. The full game consists of: The Interface — one Wolfram notebook file that compiles into a .cdf (which can be played on the free CDFplayer); Question Modules — 225 Wolfram notebooks that deploy into cloud objects, each of which returns randomly generated questions for the game; and several hundred images for the interface and the questions.
